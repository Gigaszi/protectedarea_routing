# protectedarea_routing

This repository offers ways to check your next outdoor trip to see how it overlaps with protected areas and helps you find alternative routes in the same region.
At /QGIS/Datenbasis/Schutzgebiete/dataframe.gpkg you can find the dataset with the protected areas and the associated information and use it in a GIS of your choice for your next trip planning.
